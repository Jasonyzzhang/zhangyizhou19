I am a PhD student in [Computing and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/) at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/), advised by [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and [Eric Mazumdar](https://www.ericmazumdar.com). My research tackles decision-making in multi-agent systems through game theory, reinforcement learning, and control, with a current emphasis on strategic risk aversion, robustness, and privacy in learning algorithms.

My recent work explores how to design provably convergent learning dynamics for general-sum Markov games, how risk-aware actor-critic methods shape strategic behavior, and how intrinsic regularization (e.g., KL terms) can deliver differential privacy in bandits and RLHF without explicit noise injection. I am broadly interested in decision-making at the intersection of economics, safety, and generative models for data-efficient policy learning.

Previously, I earned my B.Eng in Computer Science ([Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/)) from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I spent time as a visiting undergrad student at Caltech through the [Visiting Undergraduate Research Program (VURP)](https://sfp.caltech.edu/undergraduate-research/programs/visiting-undergraduate-research-program) and as a research intern at the [Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute](https://www.sqz.ac.cn/) working on platform economics.

When I am not coding, reading papers or proving convergence guarantees, I enjoy working out in the gym, playing basketball, cooking and listening to music.
